Codaisseur Assignment: Valley of dinos.

This is a basic CRUD-app which is created with RoR to recap everything I learned during week one.
The objective was to make the Index, show, new, create, edit, update and destroy options work.
Second was to make an one to many relationship to add dinos to valleys.
